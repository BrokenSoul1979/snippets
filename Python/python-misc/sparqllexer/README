A small module I wrote for my diploma thesis in 2009 / 2010, which dealt
about semantic technologies like OWL, SPARQL and related technologies.

This module contains lexer definitions for various semantic formats for 
the famous 'sphinx' syntax highlighting tool, which are:

    - SPARQL
    - Turtle
    - Manchester Syntax

And at least - not directly related to semantic languages - a lexer for:

    - LDraw

a CAD Tool for designing digital LEGO(R) models.

Please note that there are by far not complete or perfect. I just 
implemented everything I needed. Feel free to accomplish this task or
use this as a basic for writing a more sophisticated lexer :-)
